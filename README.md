# FAQ
Here you can find the most common questions and their respective answer. Simple as that.

Q - How do i use wakeblock?
A - Once you have installed the app, just open it and click on "install core mod", the app will install itself (this might take a while). When the phone has rebooted, open the app: If the message says "Service Bound" you're all set!

Q - How do i block the wakelocks?
A - From within the app, just switch to the "Wakelock" tab. Here every wakelock recorded since the first boot with the core mod installed, so give it at least 2/3 days of normal use before blocking anything. Click on the wakelock you want to block, press the "Block" button and then set for how long is the wakelock gonna be blocked!

Q - Which wakelock should i block? For how long?
A - We suggest to check out the Amplify guide on XDA (https://goo.gl/NUYbCj). Remember: if you don't find one of the wakelocks, just check in later. If you still don't find it, don't worry at all! Side note: the search button is not case-sensitive.

Q - I'm lazy af and i don't want to read all of that, can't you give me a short list?
A - Ok, but we don't take any responsibilities if the phone bricks or your rom explodes. You are totally free to change the blocking time value to make it as you please but, again, we don't take any responsibilities. You can find the list here: https://goo.gl/xAE8ny

Q - When is the new version/fix/graphic coming?
A - Don't ask for an ETA. We do this for free, without any ads in the app nor donation packages, we don't even put a price on our app. We all have jobs, university and a private life to manage, we don't have superpowers, so managing all of this takes time. Our free time is pretty short, but we usually put at least half of it on the developing of the app. Be patient and do not harass the team nor the telegram group.

Q - Can i block the [wakelock name] wakelock?
A - If it is part of the list down here, you're good to go! If not, we can't assure a thing, but if you find any safe-to-block wakelock let us know!

Q - Your app killed [insert random feature here] in my phone!
A - The app itself doesn't do anything. Everything is done just by user input, so unless you blocked something we didn't i think the problem and the app are unrelated.

Q - Your app is killing my battery life! WTF!
A - Check if you greenified the app by mistake, it should stay outside of anything but the basic android optimization.

Q - How can i remove this app?
A - First of all, we are sad that you want to leave us. As for the app, if you didn't install the Core Mod, or it failed in any way, you'll need just to delete the app and everything is gone! If you did install successfully the Core Mod, replace the service.odex you find in the data folder (sdcard/wakeblock) and then delete the app. Otherwise, we suggest a flash of the system.img of your rom.

Q - I found a bug! How can i make a report?
A - First of all, check on the telegram group (https://t.me/wakeblock) if anyone else had your problem, both by first searching and then asking directly. If no one can help you on the spot, send a ticket on the @WakeBlockSupportBot. It will ask for a logcat, so make sure you make one while you encounter the problem. DO NOT CONTACT ANYONE OF THE TEAM UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED TO

Q - Wow! You guys are awesome!
A - Thank you! Your feedback is precious for us!
